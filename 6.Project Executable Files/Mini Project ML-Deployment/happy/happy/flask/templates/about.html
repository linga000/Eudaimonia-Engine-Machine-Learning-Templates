            HAPPINESS CLASSIFICATION.
        </h3>
        <P>
            The Eudaimonia Engine is a sophisticated machine learning system designed to explore and classify human happiness based on various psychological and behavioral indicators. By analyzing vast datasets encompassing factors such as social interactions, emotional expressions, lifestyle choices, and self-reported well-being measures, the system aims to uncover nuanced patterns and correlations that contribute to individual happiness levels.

        <p> Leveraging advanced algorithms and predictive modeling techniques, the Eudaimonia Engine provides insights into the multifaceted nature of happiness, offering valuable guidance for personal development, mental health interventions, and societal well-being initiatives.</p>
        <P>It is quite easy to observe this level of happiness because of the immediate feelings of joy people experience. These types of emotions are also pretty easy to measure and compare because brain scans show that certain parts of our brain are active when we have these emotions.This level of happiness is pleasurable but the good feelings do not last for very long and we will return to our “baseline” mental state quite quickly.</P>
        <p>Sometimes referred to as well-being The second level of happiness is more thoughtful and requires an assessment that goes beyond the momentary feelings of level one. Questions about happiness and well-being normally works at this level - if you are asked about how happy you are with your life in general your answer will reflect a level two assessment of your happiness (probably you are not enjoying a hobby or having sex when asked this question so level one is out).</p>
        <p>The third level of happiness represents fulfilment at a higher level - achieving one's full potential. It can be seen as accomplishments with a higher meaning and has to do with self-realization.Level 3 happiness is more difficult to measure than the other two levels. People high in level 3 happiness live more in harmony with their deeper values and therefore have fewer inner conflicts because they often feel that what they do has meaning and is contributing to a greater cause.</p>
